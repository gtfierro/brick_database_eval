# Brick Database Eval


DBs to evaluate:
- [Jena/Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/):
    - also need to experiment w/ different ordering of clauses in SPARQL query
- [neo4j/sparql](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/sparql-plugin):
    - blog w/ basic directions: http://www.snee.com/bobdc.blog/2014/01/storing-and-querying-rdf-in-ne.html
- [alegrograph](http://franz.com/agraph/downloads/)
    - has free download!
- [rdf3x](https://github.com/gh-rdf3x/gh-rdf3x)
- [python rdflib](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [top braid](http://www.topquadrant.com/products/topbraid-live/)
    - expensive!
- Cayley/gremlin:
    - supposedly full Gremlin query lang can translate btwn SPARQL,
      but the subset currently implemented in Cayley cannot
